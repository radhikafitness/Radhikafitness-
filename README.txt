Radhika Fitness - PWA Package
Files included:
- index.html
- logo.png
- data_workouts.json
- data_diets.json
- manifest.json

How to use (Quick):
1) Unzip files to any static web host (Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting, or simple GitHub Pages).
   - Example: For GitHub Pages, create a new repo, push these files to main branch, enable GitHub Pages.
2) Open the hosted URL in mobile Chrome. You can "Add to Home screen" to install like an app.
3) To publish on Play Store:
   - Use PWABuilder (https://www.pwabuilder.com) to generate Android package (Trusted Web Activity) or use Bubblewrap.
   - PWABuilder can create Android (.aab) that you can upload to Google Play Console.
   - You will need a Google Play Developer account (~₹1,500 one-time).

If you want, I can:
- Deploy this PWA to free hosting (GitHub Pages) and give you the live link.
- Use PWABuilder to generate AAB and provide the download-ready package.
Reply with what you want next:
A) "Deploy" — I will deploy to GitHub Pages and give live link.
B) "AAB" — I will generate Play Store AAB using PWABuilder instructions for you.
C) "Both" — Deploy + prepare AAB instructions and assets.
